Key: <p>lemon source is a space for the collaborative development of ontology-lexica.
    Here you can upload your lexica and access them from anywhere as well as sharing them with your 
    colleagues. In addition we maintain a set of publically available lexica that can be edited by 
    anyone. To view the set of public lexica click <a href='#Special:PublicLexica'>
    here</a>.</p>
    <p>lemon source builds on the lemon model which is a flexible 
    model for creating and sharing lexica on the semantic web and uses the 
    <a href='http://www.lexinfo.net'>LexInfo</a> model for describing data 
    categories in the model.</p>
    <p>In addition lemon source integrates a state-of-the-art automatic system 
    for generating lexica using NLP tools, that allows lemon lexica to be 
    automatically inferred from ontology files specified in OWL. 
    Note that this feature is only available to logged-in users, which is 
    performed by <a href='http://openid.net'>OpenID</a> so you can uses
